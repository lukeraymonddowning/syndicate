# Contributing to Syndicate

Any help to keep this project up and running is greatly appreciated. I really value open source and want to give back the community. Your help makes that desire a reality.

I do, however, have expectations for code submitted to this repository. These expectations are not cumbersome; they are necessary to ensure a high level of quality and stability for users. So, in no particualar order, here they are:

1) All pull requests must pass every existing test in the package.
2) All pull requests must include tests that cover any code added, and these must pass.
3) All code should have a test coverage of 95% or higher. Any less than this will not be accepted. 
3) Where possible, abstractions should be used instead of concrete classes, allowing for end users to switch them out as desired.
4) Code must be clean, well formatted and use modern language patterns where applicable. Code will be run through automated styling during CI but this is not an excuse for sloppy programming.
5) Comments should be kept to a minimum. Declarative, descriptive code should be the norm, negating the need for comments.

I hope you're not rolling your eyes after reading the above. My aim is not to scare, or to bash buzz words about the room. Rather, these are expectations I set for myself after seeing the undeniable benefit of them in my work.

Thank you again for all your hard work and effort!
